This is Jose Portales repository for UP221- Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science.

## Introduction

Im a 4th year international exchange student from Chile for the Winter Quarter. Im majoring in Urban Planning and Geography. I have little backround in R, and some level of ArcGis studio. I look forward in this course to expand my knowledge in the managment of Data Bases and the improvement in the reproduction of sophisticated and specific Geospatial infromation.

## Course Objectives

My knowledge is reduced to a very superfitial use of ArcGis Studio, being able to reproduce a basic Cartography through a basic managment of the Data Base and some processing. With this course, im looking forward to work independently in specific Data Bases, and generate sophisticated processing and coding in the data, to subsequently reproduce more complex geospatial illustrations. My interest to work throughout the quarter are Urban Sprawl and clusteting around the Metropolitan Area of Los Angeles.
