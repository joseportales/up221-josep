## Let's pull

First, grab the course material, and "pull" it into your JupyterHub:

* [UP221 Git Puller](https://jupyter.idre.ucla.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyohman%2F23W-UP221&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2F23W-UP221%2F&branch=main) 
(This link will automatically launch JupyterHub and clone the course material into your directory)
