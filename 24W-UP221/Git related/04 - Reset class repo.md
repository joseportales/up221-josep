## Resetting the class repo

At the start of every week, I will ask you to reset your class git repo. What I mean by this is that it is likely that the instructors have made changes since we last met, and therefore, we want you to have the latest copy of the class materials. Note that this will overwrite any changes you made to the files in the course repo. It will not delete any duplicate files, or additional files that you may have created.

To reset the repo, do the following:

1. log into the class Jupyter Hub
1. go to New, Terminal
1. Navigate to the directory that has the class repo
1. In the command prompt, type the following commands

``` 
git reset --hard
git pull
```
